# hr

A file-first RSS / blog reader. Articles live as plain markdown files
in a git-syncable vault. There is no database — `find`, `grep`, `git`,
and your editor are the UI.

```sh
hr init <name> [dir]   # scaffold a vault
hr sync                # fetch feeds, write articles + sidecars
hr list                # list articles (pretty, --tsv, --json)
hr read <path>...      # mark as read (sidecar mutation)
hr unread <path>...
hr fav <path>...       # toggle favorite
hr alias <path> [name] # local display label (no [name] = clear)
```

Nvim panel: `~/.dotfiles/nvim/lua/hr/init.lua`. `<leader>r` toggles a
sidebar with its own buffer keys (`<CR>`/`o`/`r`/`u`/`f`/`a`/`R`/`s`/`q`/`?`).

## Vault layout

```
<vault>/
  hr.toml                                # config (committed)
  feeds/<feed>/<date>-<slug>-<id>.md     # article content (committed)
  feeds/<feed>/<date>-<slug>-<id>.meta.toml   # mutable state (committed)
  .hr/                                   # gitignored
    cache.json                           # ETag / Last-Modified per feed
    raw/<feed>/<date>-<slug>-<id>.html   # original HTML, mirrors feeds/
    err.txt                              # one line per error during sync
~/.hrrc                                  # local pointer: vault = "..."
```

The `<id>` segment is the first 8 hex chars of `sha1(GUID || URL ||
title)`, so the same item lands on the same path across machines.

## Storage design

### Properties

- **Plain text everywhere.** Markdown body, YAML frontmatter, TOML
  config & sidecar, JSON cache. If `hr` disappears, the vault stays
  usable in any editor.
- **Immutable content, mutable state.** Article `.md` files are
  written once at fetch time and never touched again. Per-article
  state (`read`, `read_at`, `favorite`, `tags`, `alias`) lives in a
  sibling `.meta.toml` that only `hr read`/`unread`/`fav`/`alias`
  modifies. Small files, mergeable in git.
- **No DB lock-in.** Migrate the vault by `mv`. Bulk operations are
  `grep`/`find`/`fd`.
- **Git is the sync layer.** Commit the vault, push, pull on another
  machine; `hr` reads it without any cross-machine state.
- **Raw HTML archive.** `<vault>/.hr/raw/<id>.html` keeps the original
  feed body. If a future conversion bug or readability improvement
  warrants reprocessing, the source is local.

### Known limitations

- **Lossy HTML → markdown conversion.** Body goes through
  `JohannesKaufmann/html-to-markdown` plus `Kunde21/markdownfmt/v3`
  canonicalization plus our `cleanBody` (strips leading nav `<h1>`s).
  The raw HTML archive (above) is the recovery path.
- **No schema version field.** Adding sidecar/frontmatter fields is
  forward-compatible (zero values are fine); removing them silently
  orphans data. Bump `schema = N` if/when this matters.
- **No tests yet.** Filename derivation, sidecar I/O, alias toggling
  are uncovered.

## Formatting

There's no Go library for markdown-aware hard column wrap (checked:
`Kunde21/markdownfmt` doesn't expose one; `yuin/goldmark` is a parser
toolkit; `muesli/reflow` is markdown-blind). So:

- **Canonicalize structure** during sync via `markdownfmt.Process`.
  This normalizes heading style, list markers, link refs, and code
  fences across feeds.
- **No hard wrap on disk.** Paragraphs from `html-to-markdown` stay as
  produced (typically one line per paragraph). This keeps `.md` files
  source-of-truth and avoids reformatting churn on resyncs.
- **Display wrap in nvim** via a markdown filetype autocmd
  (`wrap` + `linebreak` + `breakindent`). User config; not shipped by `hr`.

Same trade-off `nom` makes — it doesn't pre-wrap either, just renders
nicely at view time with `glamour`. `hr`'s "view time" is nvim.

## Refresh resolution

`hr sync` is idempotent and **never overwrites user-mutable state.**

| What                         | Created by           | Modified by                  | Sync behavior on re-run      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `hr.toml`                    | `hr init`            | user                         | untouched                    |
| `feeds/.../*.md`             | first `hr sync`      | user (if they choose)        | **skipped if exists**        |
| `feeds/.../*.meta.toml`      | first `hr sync`      | `hr read`/`fav`/`alias`/user | **untouched** after creation |
| `.hr/cache.json`             | `hr sync`            | `hr sync`                    | overwritten each run         |
| `.hr/raw/<feed>/<name>.html` | first `hr sync`      | —                            | **skipped if exists**        |
| `.hr/err.txt`                | `hr sync` (on error) | —                            | appended                     |

Implications:

- **You can edit article files freely.** Sync won't clobber them.
  Frontmatter additions (`summary: "..."`, custom tags) survive.
- **Sidecar state persists across resyncs.** Mark something read,
  resync 100 times, still read.
- **Aliases are committed.** They live in `.meta.toml`, which is in
  the vault, which is in git → aliases sync to other machines. If you
  want truly machine-local aliases, the design needs to move them to
  `.hr/aliases.json` (gitignored). Not done yet.
- **Stale content stays stale.** If a feed corrects a published item
  (typo fix, retitling), `hr` keeps the original on disk — same GUID
  → same hash → same path → skipped. To force a fresh copy, delete
  the `.md` and `.meta.toml` and run `hr sync`. A future `hr refresh
<path>` command would do this targeted.
- **Cross-machine merge conflicts** can only happen on `.meta.toml`
  (everything else is either immutable or gitignored). The files are
  small and line-oriented; most conflicts auto-merge. Real
  collisions need human attention via `git`.

The bias is **stability over freshness**: existing files are the
source of truth, sync only adds new ones.
